		<h1>Lying in Huck Finn</h1>
		<h2>Though Twain may seem to suggest that lying is always acceptable since Huck hardly receives any consequences for his mostly-harmless lying, by introducing more malicious characters he rejects the notion by using lying to beget evil. In doing so, Twain defines a boundary between "good lying" and "bad lying."</h2>

				<h2>Jim not telling Huck that it was Pap in the house</h2>
				<p class="quote">It's a dead man. Yes, indeedy; naked, too. He's ben shot in de back. I reck'n he's ben dead two er three days. Come in, Huck, but doan' look at his face—it's too gashly (50).</p>
				<p>In this scene, Huck and Jim find a house floating down the river. Jim finds a dead body and recognizes it as Pap, but refuses to tell Huck.</p>
				<p>Twain utilizes lying as a form of protection in this passage. Huck doesn’t want to see the dead body, and Jim covers up the body’s head, so that Huck can be spared the reality of learning of his father’s death. Twain implies that Jim’s decision to lie to Huck was a responsible choice.</p>

				<h2>Huck lying to Judith Loftus</h2>
				<p class="quote">Next morning I said it was getting slow and dull, and I wanted to get a stirring-up some way. I said I reckoned I would slip over the river and find out what was going on. Jim liked that notion; but he said I must go in the dark and look sharp (54).</p>
				<p class="quote">So I said it wouldn't be no use to try to play it any longer, and I would just make a clean breast and tell her everything... Then I told her my father and mother was dead... (60)</p>
				<p>In this scene, Huck resolves to get information from the town on his and Jim’s disappearances. He slips into the town undetected by disguising himself as a girl and lying about his name. Even when Mrs. Loftus exposes him as a boy, he lies about his name again and escapes without his true identity ever being revealed.</p>
				<p>The scene demonstrates the casualness with which Huck deceives the people he meets. The question of the morality of deceiving Mrs. Loftus twice is never brought up.</p>

				<h2>Huck tries to trick Jim into thinking their separation was a dream</h2>
				<p class="quote">Huck - Huck Finn, you look me in de eye; look me in de eye. Hain’t you ben gone away (84)?</p>
				<p class="quote">Gone away? Why, what in the nation do you mean? I hain’t been gone anywheres. Where would I go to (84)?</p>
				<p>After Huck and Jim’s separation near the mouth of the Ohio River, Huck reunites with Jim and decides to convince him that their separation was only one of Jim’s dreams.</p>
				<p>Unlike lying to Mrs. Loftus, lying to Jim has no practical purpose; the title of the chapter, “I Fool Poor Old Jim,” implies that Huck lied for his own amusement. With no benefits to gain from lying, the incident is cast in a negative light when Huck eventually decides that his lying was wrong and apologizes to Jim.</p>

				<h2>Huck lying to the duke and dauphin when they meet</h2>
				<p class="quote">Goodness sakes! Why would a runaway nigger run south?... My folks was living in Pike County, in Missouri, where I was born, and they all died off but me and pa and my brother Ike (126).</p>
				<p>Huck meets two con artists who call themselves the duke and dauphin. When they question Jim’s status as a runaway slave, Huck makes up yet another story to cover for Jim.</p>
				<p>Through lying to the duke and dauphin, Huck protects Jim from being reported. While this protection is imperfect - the duke and dauphin could easily turn Jim in at any time - the event is similar to Jim hiding Pap’s dead body from Huck as a form of protection.</p>

				<h2>Duke lies to the townspeople at the religious meeting</h2>
				<p class="quote">Well, the first I knowed the king got a-going, and you could hear him over everybody; and next he went a-charging up onto the platform, and the preacher he begged him to speak to the people, and he done it. He told them he was a pirate... poor as he was, he was going to start right off and work his way back to the Indian Ocean, and put in the rest of his life trying to turn the pirates into the true path... When we got back to the raft and he came to count up he found he had collected eighty-seven dollars and seventy-five cents (132).</p>
				<p>The duke and dauphin arrive in a town and discover the entire population is attending a mass religious meeting. Amidst the clamor and emotion, the duke claims to be a former pirate from the Indian Ocean and takes up a collection to fund a trip back to reform the natives.</p>
				<p>While the incident is one of the shorter duke and dauphin frauds, Twain begins exposing the malicious fraud that lying can cause. This is the first incident in which a character has lied with truly evil intent, in contrast to Huck, who has lied very freely but never sought to con anyone.</p>

				<h2>Duke and Dauphin lie to the Wilks family</h2>
				<p class="quote">So then I lit out - for bed, I said, meaning some time or another. When I got by myself I went to thinking the thing over. I says to myself, shall I go to the doctor, private, and blow on these frauds? No - that won't do (176).</p>
				<p>The duke and dauphin pretend to be a family’s long-lost relatives from Europe and collect inheritances of significant amounts of money. Huck takes actions to steal back the money and expose the duke and dauphin.</p>
				<p>In attempting to expose the duke and dauphin, Huck confirms the malice of the two as bad enough to take action against. The capacity of lying to beget evil is at its highest here: the duke and dauphin conspire to con a family out of all their property, a far cry from Huck’s relatively benign lie to Mrs. Loftus. Twain highlights the evil that can be brought about through lying, and draws contrast between the planned conning of the duke and dauphin and the lies Huck tells for survival and protection.</p>

				<h2>Huck tries to convince the doctor and lawyer he’s from England</h2>
				<p class="quote">Set down, my boy; I wouldn’t strain myself if I was you. I reckon you ain’t used to lying, it don’t seem to come handy; what you want is practice (199).</p>
				<p>After the real Wilks relatives arrive in town, debate arises concerning the genuineness of the real Wilks and the duke and dauphin. Joining the conversation, Huck tries to tell stories of his life in England, but the doctor and lawyer easily see through his lies and laugh him off, telling him he needs practice.</p>
				<p>This incident marks another of Huck’s harmless lies punctuating more malicious lies from other characters. Through the doctor and lawyer encouraging Huck to practice lying, Twain reminds the reader that there still exists a humorous, relatively benign side of lying. However, Twain overshadows Huck’s minor lies by following the event immediately with more discussion of the duke’s and dauphin’s deceit.</p>
