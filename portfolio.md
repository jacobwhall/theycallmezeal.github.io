# For-realsies work

I led the front end of a complete website rewrite for [Unified Democracy](http://teensforteens.info). *(Ironically, I pay no attention to politics.)*

# Minecraft

Under the handle Lapiman, I've done some Minecrafty stuff...

I have released one mod: [Gold in Them Thar Hills](https://github.com/theycallmezeal/goldinthemtharhills)

I am working on a second: [Grimcraft](https://github.com/thinkplank/grimcraft)

I've also written Japanese localizations for... [Galacticraft](https://github.com/micdoodle8/Galacticraft/blob/master/src/main/resources/assets/galacticraftcore/lang/ja_JP.lang) | [Quark](https://github.com/Vazkii/Quark/blob/master/src/main/resources/assets/quark/lang/ja_JP.lang)

*There was a time when I wanted to be anonymous. So if you see anything under the Lapiman Github account, it's me.*

# Miscellany

[Rejected tjTODAY](http://twitter.com/rejectedtjTODAY)

A parody account lambasting my former high school. I created this and ran it from junior year to senior year, ending in June of 2016. The account has been passed on to some successors, so any headlines more recent than that are not my responsibility...

[Most Bootylicious Senator](https://most-bootylicious-senator.herokuapp.com)

A completely 100% serious hot-or-not website made to teach myself the ins and outs of Ruby on Rails. *Due to the Heroku hosting, you might have to refresh the page on your first visit to get it to show up.*

A project on Huckleberry Finn for English 11.

[The Comparatron](/pf/comparatron)

Type in anything you want and The Comparatron will compare it to something. Ever so slightly salty.

[Nouveau America Baby Namer](/pf/babynamer)

This generator is perfect if you want a name for your child that says, we're a couple who loves creativity and who also doesn't care if our kids get bullied throughout their entire childhood.
