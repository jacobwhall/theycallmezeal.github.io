# For-realsies work

I led the front end of a complete website rewrite for [Unified Democracy](http://teensforteens.info). *(Ironically, I pay no attention to politics.)*

# Web

Airpnp (link coming soon)

A catalog and ratings website for bathrooms at W&M. Uses Django.

[Most Bootylicious Senator](https://most-bootylicious-senator.herokuapp.com)

A completely 100% serious hot-or-not website that uses Ruby on Rails. *Due to the Heroku hosting, you might have to refresh the page on your first visit to get it to show up.*

# Video

I do 2D animation and motion graphics in Adobe After Effects and Photoshop.

# Minecraft

Under the handle Lapiman, I've done some Minecrafty stuff...

I have released one mod: [Gold in Them Thar Hills](https://github.com/theycallmezeal/goldinthemtharhills)

I am working on a second: [Grimcraft](https://github.com/thinkplank/grimcraft)

I've also written Japanese localizations for... [Galacticraft](https://github.com/micdoodle8/Galacticraft/blob/master/src/main/resources/assets/galacticraftcore/lang/ja_JP.lang) | [Quark](https://github.com/Vazkii/Quark/blob/master/src/main/resources/assets/quark/lang/ja_JP.lang)

*There was a time when I wanted to be anonymous. So if you see anything under the Lapiman Github account, it's me.*

# Writing

[Rejected tjTODAY](http://twitter.com/rejectedtjTODAY)

A parody Twitter account lambasting my thankfully-former high school. I created this and still run it with the help of some successors.

[Over8d](http://over8d.wordpress.com)

A blog I wrote in middle school, which was probably when I peaked.
