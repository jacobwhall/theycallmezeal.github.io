# For-realsies work

I'm a director of web design at [Unified Democracy](http://teensforteens.info), a political action committee that's all about increasing student political participation. *(Ironically, I pay no attention to politics.)*

# Minecraft

Under the handle Lapiman, I've done some Minecrafty stuff...

*There was a period of time when I wanted to be anonymous. So if you see anything under the Lapiman Github account, it's me.*

The creator, [Pahimar](http://pahimar.com), removed localizations a while ago, but dig in the history and you'll find me. (I owe a thank-you to Pahi for providing the inspiration to start my modding journey.)

[Grimcraft](https://github.com/thinkplank/grimcraft)

I've been working on this since freshman year of high school. It was originally a two-person affair, me and my friend [Fox Wilson](http://fwilson.me), and we called ourselves The Think Plank. Then he lost interest and started becoming accomplished instead.

# Miscellany

[Rejected tjTODAY](http://twitter.com/rejectedtjTODAY)

A parody account lambasting my former high school. I created this and ran it from junior year to senior year, ending in June of 2016. The account has been passed on to some successors, so any headlines more recent than that are not my responsibility...

[Most Bootylicious Senator](https://most-bootylicious-senator.herokuapp.com)

A completely 100% serious hot-or-not website made to teach myself the ins and outs of Ruby on Rails. *Due to the Heroku hosting, you might have to refresh the page on your first visit to get it to show up.*

[Huck Finn!](/pf/huckfinn)

A project on Huckleberry Finn for English 11.

[The Comparatron](/pf/comparatron)

Type in anything you want and The Comparatron will compare it to something. Ever so slightly salty.

[Over8d](http://over8d.wordpress.com)

A blog I updated throughout middle school. Mostly nostalgic.
