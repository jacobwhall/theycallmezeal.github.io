<p>The assignment: take pixels from an image and turn them into a field of dominos ready to be knocked over - the catch: you can only do it with code.</p>

<p>So here's the image:</p>

<p><img src="/images/animation/6/fud.jpg" alt="food on a table"></p>

<p>But we also watched <a href="https://vimeo.com/100576137">this</a> in class:</p>

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/100576137?color=ffffff" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>And so here's what I turned it into:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6vsgtBPr_Tg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Because sometimes you just got somethin' to say.</p>

<p>(The Latin translates to: they stood, they fell, I hated it.)</p>
