<p>Enter: the CS major haunted house.</p>

<p>The attractions:</p>

<ul>
	<li>241. Data structures. Severed limbs hanging from linked list chains.</li>
	<li>243. Discrete structures. You have to jump through a flaming hoop of big-O notation. (It's n log n, the scariest kind.)</li>
	<li>301. Software dev. The weedout course of the major, its central project has you implementing a maze game. Guest appearance from Professor Kemper.</li>
	<li>303. Algorithms. Binary tree forest fire.</li>
	<li>304. Computer organization. Assembly.</li>
	<li>312. Principles of programming languages. A stack frame getting beheaded in a guillotine.</li>
	<li>Animation. We're safe! Safe at last! Finally!</li>
	<li>...wait... what's happening? What? What?</li>
	<li>FINITE AUTOMATA. THE FINAL BOSS BATTLE OF THE MAJOR. ALAN TURING GLARES AT YOU WHILE MY GPA DROPS AND DROPS AND DROPS AND DROPS AND</li>
</ul>

<p>This was a fun storyboard to draw:</p>

<p><img src="/images/animation/4/storyboard.jpg" alt="storyboard"></p>

<p>The principles of animation I showcased best:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Ease in / ease out.</strong>The camera is animated with a combination of motion paths and keyframes - every single keyframe transition (really!) is eased in and out.</li>
	<li><strong>Overlapping action.</strong>Translations and rotations overlap to give more natural motion. The alternative would be something like: slide to the right. Then turn to the left. Take it back now y'all. Five hops this time. I want natural camera movement, not... that.</li>
	<li><strong>Arcs.</strong>This is partially a natural consequence of using ease in / ease out and overlapping action together, and partially intentional, but the camera does arc and swoop its way through space.</li>
</ul>

<p>Still pictures won't do these justice, so go watch the durned video again, or look at my graph editor:</p>

<p>I could work on my staging - the timing of how long I spend on each focal point could be tweaked more. But, like, I spent twelve hours on this stupid thing - it was meant to be fifteen seconds, tops, and I ended up with over two minutes of pure animated hatred towards my major, so...</p>

<p>I'm a happy guy.</p>

<p>Except when I'm in CS classes.</p>
