<p>The assignment: animate a Rube Goldberg machine.</p>

<p>I wanted to go for recognizable everyday objects instead of, say, the obvious dominoes and balls, since I've always thought the appeal of a Rube Goldberg is that you're making an imperfect, hodgepodge array of items move in precise, controlled ways. So I decided on an office supply theme and modeled myself:</p>

<p>Some post-its, some ballpoint pens, and a dry-erase marker! (I'm particularly proud of how I got the marker to roll in a circular path due to its tapering, just like a real marker does.)</p>

<p>A ruler, another dry-erase marker, and some wet wipes!</p>

<p>But that's the boring animation part of this assignment (and when the animation part is the boring part, you know it's getting good). Back in my childhood I (actually!) had a Rube Goldberg phase. I grew up on <a href="https://youtu.be/KdtjF5tXFe4">FlippyCat</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/vrCb_fNmSTA">Joseph Herschel</a> and the <a href="https://youtu.be/qybUFnY7Y8w">This Too Shall Pass</a> video. So I knew this assignment had to pay tribute to this old obsession of mine - and what better way to do it than with an actual, real-life Rube Goldberg?</p>

<p>Many thanks to Atiya and Jack for helping me steal office supplies to build that Rube Goldberg, and for my bosses for not firing me upon finding out I did this...</p>

<p>This video is also dedicated to my friend Paul - during <a href="http://cypher.cs.wm.edu">our last hackathon</a> we fell in love with Amii Stewart's Knock on Wood. So I thought - what's the ultimate goal of this Rube Goldberg? And then I thought of Paul. And thus the Woodknocker was born.</p>

<p>I don't know what's more awkward - owning this, or having to go outside, find a suitable piece of wood, and carry a huge stick back into the library so I could film the video.</p>

<p>The lengths I go for my art.</p>
