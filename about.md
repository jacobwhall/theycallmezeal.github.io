I attend the [College of William and Mary](http://wm.edu), graduating spring 2020. I study computer science and linguistics.

# I like language

I speak B1 Japanese, German, and Chinese on the [CEFR scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages).

As [Professor Dan Parker](http://www.wm.edu/as/linguistics/parker/about.html)'s research assistant I work with a ACT-R model of sentence processing - basically, I use computers to figure out what happens in your brain when you hear a sentence.

# I do computery stuff

I do webdev, I lean front-end and I like making websites usable and neat-looking.

* Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, Ruby, Python, C, C++, LaTeX.
* Frameworks and whatnot: Ruby on Rails, Django, Vue.js, Node.js, Android, Wordpress, Git, Linux.

This site is built on Jekyll.
