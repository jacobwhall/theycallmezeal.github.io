I attend the [College of William and Mary](http://wm.edu) and I'm set to graduate in 2020. I study computer science and linguistics.

# I like language

I speak Japanese at around a B1 level and German and Chinese at around A2.

I assist [Professor Dan Parker](http://parker.blogs.wm.edu) with his linguistics research.

# I do web design

I lean front-end and I like making websites usable and neat-looking.

* HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
* Java, Python, Ruby.
* Experience with backend development using Ruby on Rails.
* Adobe Photoshop.

Check out my [portfolio](portfolio.html) for some of my work.

This site is built on Jekyll.

# I am capable of other things

Occasionally I write things and I [put them here.](writing.html)

I'm the 16th best Just Dance player in the United States (not kidding).

I also like cooking, video editing (I can use Adobe After Effects), and Tetris.

# I can be contacted

I'm [@theycallmezeal on Twitter.](http://twitter.com/theycallmezeal) I sporadically blog at [icarlyfiorina.tumblr.com](http://icarlyfiorina.tumblr.com) as well.

I'm occasionally on IRC. Ping tcmzeal on freenode.

Here's what I looked like November of freshman year:
