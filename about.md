I'll be attending the [College of William and Mary](http://wm.edu) from 2016 to 2020.

Before that, I attended [Jefferson High School.](http://www.tjhsst.edu)

Before that, I attended [Rachel Carson Middle School](http://www.fcps.edu/RachelCarsonMS), which was way better than Jefferson.

# I speak languages

I've studied Japanese in school for many years and I'm at a B1 level.

I have also taught myself:

* German, probably A2-ish
* Spanish, also A2-ish
* Chinese, horrible

# I do web design

I lean front-end and I like making websites usable and neat-looking.

* Good at HTML, CSS, JS, Java.
* Decent at Ruby on Rails.
* Can use Photoshop and most tantamount photo-editing programs.

Check out my [portfolio](portfolio.html) for some of my work.

This site is built on Jekyll, a lovely static site generator.

# I am capable of other things

Occasionally I write things and I [put them here.](writing.html)

Other interests include theatre tech, Minecraft, Hitman, and making onion rings.

# I can be contacted

I'm [+ZealAn on Google+](http://www.plus.google.com/+ZealAn) and [@theycallmezeal on Twitter.](http://twitter.com/theycallmezeal)

I'm occasionally on IRC. Ping tcmzeal on freenode.

Here's what I looked like November of freshman year:
